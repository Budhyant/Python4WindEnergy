      "Cython is an optimizing static compiler for Python that gives you the combined power of Python and C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally the use of C-code sacrifices two main reasons for using Python, namely the high-level language and cross-platform code. \n",
      "In this context, however, cython translates normal Python code into C-code which is compiled on the target machine and imported as a normal library.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process requires the cython package, a setup script and a compiler.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The cython package is accessible from the homepage http://cython.org/, from the Python Package Index, winpython, anaconda etc.\n",
      "- The setup script can be generated automatically by the 'cython_import.py' script (found in the folder of this notebook)\n",
      "- The compiler (from http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/install.html):\n",
      "    - Linux: The GNU C Compiler (gcc) is usually present, or easily available through the package system. On Ubuntu or Debian, for instance, the command sudo apt-get install build-essential will fetch everything you need.\n",
      "    - Mac OS X: To retrieve gcc, one option is to install Apple\u2019s XCode, which can be retrieved from the Mac OS X\u2019s install DVDs or from http://developer.apple.com.\n",
      "    - Windows: A popular option is to use the open source MinGW (a Windows distribution of gcc). See the appendix for instructions for setting up MinGW manually. EPD and Python(x,y) bundle MinGW, but some of the configuration steps in the appendix might still be necessary. Another option is to use Microsoft\u2019s Visual C. One must then use the same version which the installed Python was compiled with.\n",
